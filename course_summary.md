t I have Learned

### Basics/fundamentals of Git
- **Version Control:** Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project.
- **Repositories:** A repository (repo) is a directory that contains all the project files and the entire revision history.
- **Commits:** A commit is a snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time.
- **Branches:** Branches are used to modify another member, code develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation from the main codebase.

### Common Git Commands
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: to save repo for offline access in the sysytem, Clone an existing repository from a remote server.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes to be included in the next commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Push (update)local commits to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to the local repository.

### Collaboration
- **Forking:** Creating a personal copy of someone else's repository to make changes without affecting the original repository.
- **Pull Requests:** A method to propose changes to the original repository by submitting a request for the maintainers to review and merge the changes.

## What I'm Confused About

### Pulling a Repository I am Invited To

the first confusion i encounter was the seeing README file in the reopsitory, I am still a bit unclear about the exact steps to pull a repository I’ve been invited to contribute to. Here are the specific steps I'm seeking clarity on:

1. **Accessing the Invitation:**
   - What happens after I accept the invitation?

2. **Cloning the Repository:**
   - i'm confused on how to clone a repository because is telling me to create a pass key for the ssh which i have no knowledge about, and it keeps on giving me error.
   - Do I need any special permissions or tokens to clone the repository?
   - Is the cloning process different for private vs. public repositories?

3. **Pulling Updates:**
   - How do I ensure that I am up-to-date with the latest changes in the repository?
   - how do i get nootified about pull request?

## Next Steps
To resolve my confusion, I plan to:
- Review Git documentation and tutorials on youtube specifically for pulling repositories I’ve been invited to.
- Experiment with cloning and pulling changes in different types of repositories.
- Seek advice and best practices from experienced Git users and contributors, especially from my course mate.
