# Git Learning Summary

## What I've Learned

### Basics of Git
- **Version Control:** Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and allows multiple people to collaborate on a project.
- **Repositories:** A repository (repo) is a directory that contains all the project files and the entire revision history.
- **Commits:** A commit is a snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time.
- **Branches:** Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation from the main codebase.

### Common Git Commands
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository from a remote server.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes to be included in the next commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Push local commits to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to the local repository.

### Collaboration
- **Forking:** Creating a personal copy of someone else's repository to make changes without affecting the original repository.
- **Pull Requests:** A method to propose changes to the original repository by submitting a request for the maintainers to review and merge the changes.

## What I'm Still Confused About

### Pulling a Repository I'm Invited To

I am still a bit unclear about the exact steps to pull a repository Iâ€™ve been invited to contribute to. Here are the specific steps I'm seeking clarity on:

1. **Accessing the Invitation:**
   - How do I accept an invitation to a repository?
   - What happens after I accept the invitation?

2. **Cloning the Repository:**
   - Do I need any special permissions or tokens to clone the repository?
   - Is the cloning process different for private vs. public repositories?

3. **Pulling Updates:**
   - How do I ensure that I am up-to-date with the latest changes in the repository?
   - What is the best practice for pulling changes and resolving potential conflicts?

4. **SSH Keys**
- *SSH Keys*: I'm still not completely sure how to manage multiple SSH keys for different GitHub accounts.
- *Advanced Git Commands*: I would like to learn more about advanced Git commands and their use cases.



### Advanced Git Features
- **Rebasing vs. Merging:** When should I use rebase instead of merge, and what are the potential risks?
- **Cherry-Picking:** How to apply specific commits from one
