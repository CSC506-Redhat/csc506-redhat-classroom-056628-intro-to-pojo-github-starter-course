## What I Learned

During this course, I learned the basics of GitHub, including:

- **Repositories**: How to create and manage repositories.
- **Cloning**: How to clone a repository to work on it locally.
- **Committing and Pushing**: How to commit changes and push them to the remote repository.
- **Branches**: How to create branches to work on different features without affecting the main project.
- **Pull Requests**: How to open pull requests to discuss and review changes before merging them.
- **Issues**: How to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs using issues.

### Common Git Commands
- **git init:** Set up a new Git repository.
- **git clone <repository-url>:** Copy an existing repository from a remote location.
- **git add <file>:** Prepare changes to be included in the next commit.
- **git commit -m "message":** Save the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- **git push:** Upload local commits to the remote repository.

### Collaboration
- **Forking:** Creating a personal copy of someone else's repository to make changes without affecting the original repository.
- **Pull Requests:** A method to propose changes to the original repository by submitting a request for the maintainers to review and merge the changes.

I also learned about the importance of using a README file to communicate the purpose and usage of a project to others.

## What I'm Still Confused About

While I learned a lot, there are still some areas I'm a bit confused about:

- **SSH Keys**: I'm still not completely sure how to manage multiple SSH keys for different GitHub accounts.
- **Advanced Git Commands**: I would like to learn more about advanced Git commands and their use cases.

## Experimenting with Markdown Styles

Here are some Markdown elements I experimented with:

### Blockquotes

### Code Snippets
```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
